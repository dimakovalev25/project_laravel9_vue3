                This is a quick demo app for server side rendering Vue with Laravel. Below is a list of our open source packages, which our client-side app has
                divided by type.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're using vue-router for this page so each package type has its own permalink, and will be prerendered
                on the server if visited directly.
